🔐 Day 1 of My 100 Days of Cybersecurity Challenge 🔐

Hey everyone!

I'm thrilled to kick off my 100 Days of Cybersecurity Challenge today, and what a start it has been! 🚀

Yesterday, I decided to focus on something I've been wanting to enhance for a while now - my Linux skills. 🐧💻 During my recent participation in a Capture the Flag (CTF) event, which was made possible through the WiCyS Security Training Scholarship, I realized just how crucial strong Linux skills are in the world of cybersecurity. 💪

I want to give a big shoutout and thank you to The Cyber Mentor and his amazing YouTube channel for the fantastic Linux review. The video I watched today (link below) was incredibly informative and well-structured. If you're looking to level up your Linux game, I highly recommend checking it out: https://lnkd.in/gxyQVDaq 🎥

I'm excited to share this journey with all of you, and I can't wait to see how my skills evolve over the next 99 days. Stay tuned for daily updates, insights, and resources as I continue to explore the fascinating world of cybersecurity. Let's learn and grow together! 🌐💡
