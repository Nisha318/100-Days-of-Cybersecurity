🔒 Day 2 of my 100 Days of Cybersecurity Challenge! 🔒

Day 2 was all about building stronger digital defenses! 🛡️ I dived deep into my Palo Alto Firewall lab and made some exciting progress. Here's a peek into what I accomplished:

🏭 Added a DMZ Appliance: I integrated a DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) appliance into my network topology. This strategic placement enhances my security posture by creating an additional layer of defense.

🚧 Inside-to-DMZ Policy: Implemented an inside-to-DMZ security policy to carefully control traffic between my internal network and my DMZ zone. Security is all about control and visibility, right?

🌐 Outside-to-DMZ Policy: Crafted an outside-to-DMZ security policy to safeguard my DMZ from external threats. 

🔁 NAT Policy Rule: Set up a Network Address Translation (NAT) policy rule, ensuring that traffic originating from the outside zone can securely reach my DMZ . 

With each step, I'm strengthening my cybersecurity knowledge and skills, one day at a time! 💪💻 Stay tuned for more updates on everything that I am learning related to security. Your support means the world! 🔐
