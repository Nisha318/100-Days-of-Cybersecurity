🚀 Day 3 of my #100DaysOfCybersecurity challenge is all about getting hands-on with Tenable Nessus! 🕵️‍♂️

Just dived into this powerful cybersecurity tool developed by Tenable, Inc. It's a go-to solution for vulnerability assessment and management. 

Here's a peek at what I was able to accomplish:

I downloaded and installed Nessus as a tool on my Kali Linux VM and then I initiated Basic Scans against two other devices on my home network:

💻 Hulk - a Windows 10 VM that is being used as a Universal Forwarder for sending WinEvent logs to my Splunk server

💻 GNS3 Server VM - a network simulator application that is running on a Linux Server VM

Here's what hashtag#Nessus can do:

💪 Benefits and Solutions:

🔍 Vulnerability Assessment: It scans and assesses your systems, devices, and apps to pinpoint security weaknesses, known vulnerabilities, and misconfigurations. From servers to routers, it's got you covered.

✔ Compliance Check: Helps meet regulations like PCI DSS, HIPAA, and NIST by finding non-compliance vulnerabilities.

✳ Risk Analysis: Rates vulnerabilities by severity, so you can tackle the big problems first.

📈Asset Management: Keeps your asset inventory current, making management and security easier.

👊🏽 Action Time: After scanning, prioritize, remediate, and monitor vulnerabilities. 

The following resources were helpful for my learning activities:
